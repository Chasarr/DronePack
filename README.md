# Drone app
This repository contains the android app for the [App-controlled drone](https://github.com/KTheXIII/app-controlled-drone) repository.
To use the app download the repository and import the project into the [Android Studio IDE](https://developer.android.com/studio/).

You would need to change the API KEY for google maps in the `google_maps_api.xml` file. The ipAddress and port needs to be change in the `MapsActivity.kt` file.
